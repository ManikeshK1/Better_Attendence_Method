# Better_Attendence_Method
This system reimagines classroom management by replacing slow, sequential roll calls with a rapid, randomized entry method. It allows students to call out roll numbers in any order they sit on bench in class while the teacher uses shorthand input to update records. This simple approach minimizes manual effort, saves time, reduces proxy attendance.
